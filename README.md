# WasteLessVR
My first group project in VR. Project was created in Unity, using C#

during Lenovo course on the base of Sensorama Lab, Kyiv

Sorting trash is important and we tried to make it interactive and fun.

My team: svitlua and marynakr

To run game, you must have Unity installed and run scene frim Assets folder,

later i will add exe file (it is huge, so i will find out how to add it proper)

It will definitely work with windows mr headset and might work also with htc vive and oculus rift

In the game there are two scenes and main menu

## First scene:

You have to grab and throw trash in proper container,

recyclable and non-recyclable, you can find some trash even on the tree for a limited time

You can use light beam (grip button) on object to receive hint

## Second scene

You just grab trash from conveyor and throw to proper container, limited time

Control management:

* `trigger press` grab and hold objects, climb
* `trigger release` throw object
* `menu button` call menu and choose scene
* `push trackpad on both controllers and move your arms up and down` move in place
* `grip button` teleport

## Have fun!
